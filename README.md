# LS-Plugin
This is a Google Chrome extension to make life a little easier for PBHS's Support Team when creating Launch Survey forms.
It will scan the site for procedure pages and provide the relevant code snippet for the back-end and short-codes for the front-end, reducing the time needed for these labor-intensive setups by ~50%.

**I am trying to minimize dependencies, so the code is mostly HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, but the dynamic front-end will be rendered with React and the back-end requires file-system to allow for easier adding of exclusions.**

*LS-Plugin is purely a passion project, created to satisfy my creative urges while automating a task I found monotonous and time-consuming during my time employed at PBHS. This project is in no way sponsored or endorsed by PBHS, Inc.*
